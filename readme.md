# Modal with multiple flavors!
Has someone ever came up to you and said, "Hey, I want a popup and I want it now! Also, It should support text, forms and videos. Why are you still here.  GO DO IT!"? 
Well friends, sit down and crack open a brew.  I have a treat for you.  This module comes packed with the ability to add a modal window tied to any element with a specified ID.
You want rich text?  You got it.
You need a form?  Let's go.
How about a video?  Vimeo, youtube, embedded video.  No problemo

*But how do I do it?*
This is super simple. Add the module to your page,  find the CTA or whatever you want the user to click and add an ID to it. So Example:
`<button id="clickThis">CLICK, RICK</button>`
Then, pop that ID into the module.
After that it is all gravy.  Select what kind of content you want and the relevant fields will appear
